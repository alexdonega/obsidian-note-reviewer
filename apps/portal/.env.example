# CORS Configuration
# ==============================================================================

# ALLOWED_ORIGINS - Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS
#
# This controls which domains can make cross-origin requests to the API.
# When set, this completely overrides the default origins below.
#
# Format: Comma-separated URLs (no trailing slashes)
# Example: ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://example.com,https://app.example.com,http://localhost:3000
#
# Default Origins (used if ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set):
#   - https://r.alexdonega.com.br        (Production)
#   - https://www.r.alexdonega.com.br    (Production with www)
#   - http://localhost:3000              (Development)
#   - http://localhost:3001              (Development)
#   - http://localhost:3002              (Development)
#   - http://localhost:5173              (Vite default dev server)
#   - http://127.0.0.1:3000              (Development with IP)
#   - http://127.0.0.1:5173              (Vite dev server with IP)
#
# Security Notes:
#   - Never use "*" as an origin - this is a security vulnerability
#   - Always specify full protocol (https:// or http://)
#   - In production, only use https:// origins
#   - Credentials (cookies) are only sent to explicitly allowed origins
