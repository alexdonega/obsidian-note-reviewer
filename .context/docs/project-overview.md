# Project Overview

This project, **Obsidian Note Reviewer**, is a tool designed to help users of the Obsidian note-taking application implement a structured review process. It solves the problem of knowledge decay by systematically surfacing notes for review, likely based on spaced repetition or other user-defined criteria. The primary beneficiaries are Obsidian users who want to improve long-term knowledge retention and actively engage with their digital notes.

## Quick Facts
- **Primary Languages:** TypeScript (`.tsx`, `.ts`)
- **Key Technologies:** Bun, React, Supabase, Vercel
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo containing shared packages and distinct applications.

## File Structure & Code Organization
The repository is organized as a monorepo, likely using Bun Workspaces.

### Key Directories
- `apps/` — Contains the standalone applications of the project, such as the main web interface or background services.
- `docs/` — Contains all project documentation, including this guide.
- `monitoring/` — Holds configuration for monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure.
- `packages/` — Contains shared libraries, components, and utilities consumed by the different applications in the `apps/` directory.
- `scripts/` — A collection of automation and utility scripts for tasks like deployment, data migration, or code generation.
- `supabase/` — Configuration for the Supabase backend, including database migrations, access policies, and serverless Edge Functions.
- `tests/` — Houses end-to-end and integration tests that cover multiple parts of the system.

### Important Root Files
- `package.json` — The project's manifest file, defining dependencies, scripts, and workspace configuration for the monorepo.
- `bun.lockb` — The binary lockfile generated by Bun, ensuring deterministic and fast dependency installation.
- `bunfig.toml` — Configuration file for the Bun runtime and toolkit.
- `README.md` — The main entry point for the repository, providing a high-level summary and setup instructions.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Guidelines for developers who wish to contribute to the project.
- `LICENSE` / `LICENSE_PT_BR` — The software license for the project, with an English and a Portuguese version.
- `vercel.json` — Configuration file for deploying the project to the Vercel platform.

## Technology Stack Summary
- **Runtime:** The project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its primary JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner.
- **Language:** The entire codebase is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), ensuring type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Deployment Platform:** Applications are deployed and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- **Build & Formatting:** The built-in Bun toolkit handles bundling and testing. Code formatting is likely managed by a tool like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Core Framework Stack
- **Backend:** The backend is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), which provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, object storage, and serverless Edge Functions.
- **Frontend:** The user interface is built with [React](https://react.dev/). Given the use of `.tsx` files and Vercel, it is likely using a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- **Architectural Patterns:** The project follows a **monorepo** pattern to manage code and a **serverless** architecture for the backend via Supabase and Vercel.

## UI & Interaction Libraries
- The specific UI component library (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Shadcn/ui) is defined in the `package.json` of the frontend application under `apps/`. Contributors should adhere to the established design system and components.

## Development Tools Overview
- The primary command-line tool is `bun`. Most development tasks are executed via scripts defined in `package.json` (e.g., `bun run dev`).
- For detailed setup and configuration of your local environment, please refer to the [Tooling & Productivity Guide](./tooling.md).

## Getting Started Checklist
1. Install dependencies with `bun install`.
2. Explore the project by running the main development script: `bun run dev`.
3. Review the [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) for day-to-day tasks, branching strategy, and pull request guidelines.

## AI Update Checklist
1. Review roadmap items or issues labelled “release” to confirm current goals.
2. Cross-check Quick Facts against `package.json` and environment docs.
3. Refresh the File Structure & Code Organization section to reflect new or retired modules; keep guidance actionable.
4. Link critical dashboards, specs, or runbooks used by the team.
5. Flag any details that require human confirmation (e.g., stakeholder ownership).
